# !edom rorriM  
This mod restores the cut Mirror Lens item.  
Equipping this item fully mirrors the levels you play on.  

Item can be bought from Chloe anywhere she hangs around.  

Due to fact that the mod has to modify input code, it requires Freedom Planet 2 version 1.0.5 or above. The mod might not work properly on versions before Rewired was added.  

Item itself is prone to bugs and graphical issues, use at own risk.  

When removing the mod, the item will stay in your inventory. Its completely harmless, however does not fully function.
